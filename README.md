# BeeGreen
Since the dawn of humanity, hunger has defined human existence as both by plague but also by joy after defeating it. Nowadays, hunger is rarely a problem due to its millions of unhealthy, cheap, pollution-contributing solutions. Such unsustainable ways have led to money and power-hungry corporations to exploit the unfortunate and contribute to climate change despite the fact that human civilization will fail to exist if this continues on. Some say, it is impossible to fight climate change because there are too many factors to consider, but here at BeeGreen, we believe that any and every effort is important to the cause of a greener future. Targeting the unfair market of unhealthy meal options, we have decided to create a platform that will allow for restaurants with a focus on fighting climate change to gain more recognition and get supported by likeminded customers.
